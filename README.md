# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION

## Project Overview
The **IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION** project is a machine learning exercise that aims to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This project serves as an introduction to data analysis and machine learning, using the classic Iris dataset to explore data preprocessing, visualization, and classification techniques.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to apply data processing, visualization, and machine learning techniques to accurately classify iris flowers. This project demonstrates how to handle data preprocessing, perform exploratory data analysis, and implement machine learning models in Python.

## Description
The project follows a series of steps starting from data loading, preprocessing, visualization, and finally classification. The dataset used consists of 150 samples with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the target variable, species.

## Steps:
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
2. **Data Processing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data using libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
4. **Model Building**: Implementing machine learning models to classify the iris species.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using accuracy metrics and visualizations.

## Tools and Libraries
**Python**: The programming language used for all computations.  
**Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.  
**NumPy**: For numerical computations.  
**Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.  
**Seaborn**: For making statistical graphics.  
**Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models.  

## Visualization
The project includes various visualizations such as:

**Pairplot**: Visualizing the pairwise relationships between features.  
**Heatmap**: Displaying the correlation between variables.   
**Boxplot**: Showing the distribution of numerical data and comparing between species.
